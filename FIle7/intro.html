    Postman:-
    It is an app that is used to collect all the get and post requests through a custom URL sent by the user. it minimizes our work by not allowing us to write Js in Node application. We can also skip fetching all the APIs with the help of postman.

    Express:-
    It is a web application framework for node.js released as free and open source software. it is designed for building web applications and APIs. 
    Simply it creates custom backends automatically for us as per our requirements. for ex:- we learned to create custom backends for different pages like about us, contacts , services... But express creates the servers for these pages automatically for us.

    Moreover it handles all the routines for us and also simplifies all the process in the web development for us
