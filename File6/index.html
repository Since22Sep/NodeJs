    NPM is basically a package manager for Node.Js packages or modules. it is installed on your computer when you install Node.js

    As we write npm init on the terminal it asks several questions like the package name , version , description entry point keyword etc. when we execute this there is a new file called package.json inside our directory.

    NPM init has initialized this folder in terms of a node package. now when we install any other dependency it automatically gets added to this package.

    We also get another folder called node.modules. It is a folder containing all the modules related to our project. if by mistake this folder gets deleted we can recover it back by again installing mpm by  writing npm install.

    If we want to install any specific version of the dependecny we can easily do that . ex:- npm install slugify@1.3.5 and this version gets updated

    1.3.5 -> Major.Minor.Patch

    Dev dependencies:- there are the times when we want to install the package only for development purposes not for production purposes. In that case dev dependecies are useful. best example is nodemon.

    nodemon -> it gives us the server which automatically restart every time.
    npm install nodemon --save-dev 

    to use it globally:- npm install nodemon --global
